title: Building a Deep Learning Box
---

While there are many useful and well-written blogs out there, I quickly wanted to document my own setup and some reasons that led to it.

Most people usually prefer to go with high specs that allow them to add more hardware in the future. And probably when it comes to Deep Learning, the more the better. I, however, set myself moderate expectations, both, on cost and performance front. I was looking to build a box for somewhere around 900 dollars that would allow me to gain good amount of expertise on Deep Learning topics. Computation time is currently not an issue for me. Probably, when I get to a stage where I am good at Deep Learning, I am hoping to work at a place where I get to utilize my skills and not aim at expanding study projects beyond my own box.

With the above things in mind, I went for a compact box that supports mini-itx motherboard. I really love how it looks and performs for its size !!!

#### Below is my list of parts with pricing.

<strong>I bought all of the above parts during Thanksgiving. This saved me around 250 bucks.</strong>

#### Following are some resources that helped me put together my box.

* [Build a super fast deep learning machine for under $1,000](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/build-a-super-fast-deep-learning-machine-for-under-1000)
* [Building your own deep learning box](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-your-own-deep-learning-box-47b918aea1eb)
* [Setting up a Deep learning machine in a lazy yet quick way]
(https://medium.com/impactai/setting-up-a-deep-learning-machine-in-a-lazy-yet-quick-way-be2642318850)

All of the above blogs give an in-depth description on how to setup a box. I must mention that the last two blogs are of [fastai](http://www.fast.ai/) students. I took the first version of fastai course this fall. I will discuss more on it in my subsequent blogs.
