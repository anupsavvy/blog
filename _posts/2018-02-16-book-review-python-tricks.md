This a good book for Python beginners who want to take their knowledge to next level. The best part about this book is you can go through it pretty quickly as the author is good at explaining things in a friendly tone. Although, I would rate 'Fluent Python' to be a much better book, this one serves its purpose quite well. I personally found 3 chapters to be quite useful for solidifying my understanding of Python - Effective Functions, Classes & OOP and Dictionary Tricks.

The book is really just a compilation of different Python code snippets. It is probably just easier to read the whole book first and then try the code snippets yourself. As far as the price is concerned, I think its a bit on the expensive side for the material it has to offer. I found some of the tricks are just well-known facts about Python and they failed to surprise me in any way.

In the end, this is a good book for someone who has spent a couple of months with Python and wants to get better at it in short time.
